# Git setup
<p>
<b>1a.</b> Install Git on your laptop (Mac or windows):
Head over to the git homepage: https://git-scm.com/download
Remember to select git-bash as your way of working if asked (Win/Mac).
All other default options are pretty sensible for most users.
 
To make sure that it is installed, open git bash (or terminal) and type:
git --version

If you see something like "git version 2.13.<something>" as the result, you have installed it and are good to go. The lastest version as of writing this is 2.13. If you already have git installed in a slightly older version this should be ok as well.
 
Note to mac users: You can also install git using homebrew, if you prefer.
 
<b>1b.</b> Git for Linux users:
If you are running Linux, you very probably already have git installed. If not, you probably know how to install it yourself.
On Ubuntu and similar distros you can run:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git gitk git-gui
 
Note: the default git version on most Ubuntu installs is a quite old 1.9.1. Using this version should get you through the course without any real hickups although you will have to expect slightly different output and behavior from some commands.
